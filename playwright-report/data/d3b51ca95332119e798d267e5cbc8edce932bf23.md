              - paragraph [ref=e184]: "Here’s what happened in the Czech property market in July: • Prague property prices rose 1.4%, while national prices increased by 0.4%. • Rental prices also climbed—up 1.3% in Prague and 0.4% across the country. Brno rents hit record highs and are now just 10% lower than those in Prague. • Despite this, property purchase prices in Prague remain about 25% higher than in Brno. • Mortgage interest rates rose slightly to 5.05%, likely due to fewer summer promotions from banks. • The Czech National Bank signaled no near-term changes to base rates, with inflation holding at 2.7%. Although summer is typically a quiet season for sales, both property and rental prices continued their gradual upward trend. We'll be watching closely to see how things develop after the summer period. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next update."

While activity remains strong in major cities, we’re seeing more divergence across the country. Rental market trends will become clearer after the summer. Thanks for watching, and see you again next month."

Is this a short-term peak or just a pause before the next move? • Rental rates show no strong recovery yet; increases remain modest. • Interest rates continue their gradual slide but not enough to reignite buyer activity. • Global market jitters (tariffs, inflation worries) add caution and could shape the months ahead.
